Hi! I'm Vinícius an experienced software engineer with extensive experience developing Ruby on Rails applications and complex distributed systems based on functional architecture (Clojure, Datomic, etc).
                                                                                                                                               
In my free time, I'm on a quest to prove that Rails and Event Sourcing can be _actually_ friends — building [Funes](https://github.com/viniciusalmeida/funes).
