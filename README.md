Hi! I'm Vinícius, an experienced software engineer with extensive experience developing Ruby on Rails applications and complex distributed systems based on functional architecture (mainly based on Clojure and its ecosystem).                      

In my free time, I'm on a quest to prove that Rails and Event Sourcing can _actually_ be friends — building [Funes](https://github.com/viniciusalmeida/funes), designed to feel right at home for Rails developers.
